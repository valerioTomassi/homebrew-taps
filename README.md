# My Taps

A tiny, personal Homebrew tap for my own tools, one‑off utilities, and experiments. If it lives here, it’s something I actually use on my machines. Expect small, focused, occasionally opinionated formulae.

What’s a tap? It’s just an extra repository of Homebrew formulae you can opt into.

## Quick start

`brew install valeriotomassi/taps/<formula>`

Or `brew tap valeriotomassi/taps` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "valeriotomassi/taps"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
